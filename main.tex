\section*{Activities}

Education on doctoral level is ended with doctoral degree or licentiate degree. The doctoral student also has the possibility to get a licentiate degree as a partial stage in the education. For licentiate degree the following is required:(i) approved courses of at least 30 credits; and (ii) approved scientific thesis of at least 75 credits. Thesis and courses shall together be at least 120 credits.

Tracing a parallel with the Brazilian Doctoral Studies System, the Swedish Licentiate Degree would be equivalenced to the \textit{Qualifica\c{c}\~{a}o de Proposta de Doutorado}. For that reason, defending a licentiate thesis would serve as a half-time assessment of the doctoral studies progress. 

In that sense, the activities for the next year are chronologically grouped by the papers required for my licentiate degree.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Full-conference paper for \textbf{ACM International Joint Conference on Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing}, with deadline around March:
		\begin{itemize}		
			\item Literature study: Basic concepts of distributed systems and middlewares.
			\item Identify the functional and non-functional requirements of a service platform able to deliver continuous services. Write an internal report about the results.
			\item Implement a prototype of a service platform to address the activity/inactivity detection scenario. 
			\item Prepare and run an experiment to evaluate the prototype implemented. Write a conference paper about the process and results.
		\end{itemize}
	\item Full-conference paper for \textbf{ACM/IFIP/USENIX Middleware 2017}, with deadline around June: 
		\begin{itemize}		
			\item Literature review: Service composition in smart city context, in particular how to combine capabilities of two different smart environments (e.g. smart cafeteria, smart home and smart bus)  to deliver a given service.
			\item Literature review: Service discovery in smart city context, in particular how to discover and setup resources seamlessly and automatically without any user intervention.
			\item Implement service discovery and service composition on the service platform prototype.
			\item Prepare and run an experiment to evaluate the new prototype implemented, which includes service composition and service discovery. Write a conference paper about the process and results.
		\end{itemize}
	\item Short-paper for the \textbf{ICIN Conference Innovations in Clouds, Internet and Networks 2017}, with deadline around October:
		\begin{itemize}		
			\item Literature review: Tracking user position in a smart city, in particular how to include indoor positioning systems and global positioning systems in my service platform.
			\item Implement indoor/outdoor positioning in the service platform.
			\item Prepare and run a experiment to evaluate the impact on the performance of the service provisioning when using both indoor and outdoor positioning systems. Write a conference paper about the process and results.
		\end{itemize}
	\item Final version of the \textbf{licentiate thesis}, with the deadline around November:
		\begin{itemize}		
			\item Write the licentiate thesis.
			\item Defend the licentiate degree.
		\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
