\section*{Activities}

\begin{itemize}
	\item January - March
		\begin{itemize}		
			\item Literature study: Basic concepts of distributed systems and middlewares.
			\item Identify the functional and non-functional requirements of a service platform able to deliver continuous services. Write an internal report about the results.
			\item Implement a prototype of a service platform to address the activity/inactivity detection scenario. 
		\end{itemize}
	\item April - June
		\begin{itemize}		
			\item Prepare and run an experiment to evaluate the prototype implemented. Write a conference paper about the process and results.
			\item Literature review: Service composition in smart city context, in particular how to combine capabilities of two different smart environments (e.g. smart cafeteria, smart home and smart bus)  to deliver a given service.
		\end{itemize}
	\item July - September
		\begin{itemize}		
			\item Literature review: Service discovery in smart city context, in particular how to discover and setup resources seamlessly and automatically without any user intervention.
			\item Implement service discovery and service composition on the service platform prototype.
			\item Prepare and run an experiment to evaluate the new prototype implemented, which includes service composition and service discovery. Write a conference paper about the process and results.
		\end{itemize}
	\item October - December
		\begin{itemize}		
			\item Literature review: Tracking user position in a smart city, in particular how to include indoor positioning systems and global positioning systems in my service platform.
			\item Write Licentiate Thesis.
			\item Defend Licentiate Thesis (please find out more about the Swedish Licentiate Degree in the following section).
		\end{itemize}

\section*{The Swedish Licentiate Degree}

Education on doctoral level is ended with doctoral degree or licentiate degree. The doctoral student also has the possibility to get a licentiate degree as a partial stage in the education. For licentiate degree the following is required:(i) approved courses of at least 30 credits; and (ii) approved scientific thesis of at least 75 credits. Thesis and courses shall together be at least 120 credits.

Tracing a parallel with the Brazilian Doctoral Studies System, the Swedish Licentiate Degree would be equivalenced to the \textit{Qualifica\c{c}\~{a}o de Proposta de Doutorado}. For that reason, defending a licentiate thesis would serve as a half-time assessment of the doctoral studies progress.
